This notebook had codes for a ML model to predict the credi card approval status for a client suing the data available in this link [DATA](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)

The main focus of this note is not on the model accuracy but the various approaches like data pre-processing techniques, auto ML libraries for EDA, outlier treatment, handling class imbalance, dimensionality reduction using PCA and experiment various models as listed below

  - LogisticRegression
  - KNeighbors
  - SVC
  - DecisionTree
  - RandomForest
  - XGBoost
